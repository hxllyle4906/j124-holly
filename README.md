I chose to investigate flying etiquette practices, specifically the rudeness of moving to an unsold seat, given that it has been debated amongst my social circles. I personally do not find it rude and assume many people would share similar sentiments. This specific dataset raises a lot of interesting questions regarding social norms as well as personal comfort on flights.

The chart above reveals that the majority of people do not find it rude, showing that it is very common for people to take up unsold seats on a plane. On the other hand, a small minority stated that it is rude. This data provides insight on social norms and may help facilitate further discussion on potential airline policies.
